  "abstract": "<p>From <b>October 2023 to November 2024</b>, we verified 248 incidents of white phosphorus use — <b>247 in South Lebanon and one in northern Israel (friendly fire)</b> — identified from more than <b>650 verified images and videos</b>. The website visualizes this data through an interactive cartographic platform, organizing each incident chronologically and spatially to reveal both geographic and temporal patterns.</p><p>This work seeks to expose the systematic use of white phosphorus, an incendiary weapon whose deployment in populated areas is restricted under international law due to its devastating and often fatal effects. By geolocating, verifying, and mapping each incident, the project advances transparency and accountability in warfare. It also aims to inform returning residents whose lands have been contaminated, assisting municipalities in marking affected territories and coordinating with specialized teams to detoxify and rehabilitate these areas.</p>",

      "question": "What is white phosphorus?",
      "answer": "White phosphorus is a highly reactive chemical used in military operations, primarily for creating smoke screens and as an incendiary weapon. It ignites easily upon contact with air, producing a thick white smoke that effectively conceals troop movements. The immediate consequences of exposure to white phosphorus are severe; it can cause deep, painful burns upon contact with skin. Inhalation of white phosphorus smoke can damage the respiratory tract and cause breathing difficulties. Long-term exposure is linked to more serious health issues, including chronic respiratory problems and organ damage. The effects are often severe and can be fatal."

    {
      "question": "Is it legal to use White Phosphorus?",
      "answer": "<p>White phosphorus is regulated under Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which restricts its use as an incendiary weapon in or near civilian areas. While Israel has not ratified Protocol III, it is still bound by International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and customary law, which prohibit indiscriminate attacks and require protection of civilians.</p><p>White phosphorus may be used for smoke screens or signaling under lawful conditions, but its use in populated areas — where it causes indiscriminate and severe harm — is highly contentious and may constitute a violation of international law depending on context and intent.</p>"

      "question": "Our Findings on the Use of White Phosphorus",
      "answer": "<p>Between October 2023 and November 2024, we verified 248 incidents of white phosphorus use — 247 in South Lebanon and one in northern Israel (friendly fire).</p><p><b>Temporal Pattern:</b> Approximately 91 % of all verified incidents occurred before Israel’s ground invasion in October 2024. While the stated purpose of white phosphorus is battlefield concealment, its extensive use prior to the invasion of Israeli forces suggests that the weapon was deployed in contexts not directly linked to troop movement.<br/>Limitation: Fewer recordings were available after early 2024 due to mass displacement and reduced civilian presence in the south.</p><p><b>Time of Day:</b> 79 % of strikes occurred during daylight hours, while 21 % took place at night. The overwhelming daytime concentration contradicts claims that white phosphorus was deployed for illumination.Limitation: Nighttime incidents may be underreported since fewer witnesses are awake or able to film after dark.<p><b>Land-Use Impact: </b>Of the total incidents analyzed, 39 % occurred in residential areas, 17 % in agricultural lands, and 44 % in forested or open terrain. For classification purposes, a strike is attributed to a residential, agricultural, or open-terrain area if it occurred within a 100-meter diameter of that land-use type.Israel has justified the use of white phosphorus to clear vegetation and improve visibility to prevent militants from hiding. Yet 56 % of all verified strikes occurred in inhabited and cultivated zones  —  contradicting that claim and highlighting the unlawful deployment of incendiary weapons near civilians and civilian infrastructure.<br/>Limitation: Remote areas are likely under-documented due to limited access and visibility.</p><p><b>Geographic Distribution:</b> Nearly all verified incidents were concentrated along the southern border strip, forming a dense and continuous band parallel to the Blue Line. The heaviest-hit localities include Al Khiam (30), Meiss El Jabal (28), Kfar Kila (26), Yaroun (24), Markaba (17), and Rmaych (17)  —  all within a few kilometers of the frontier. This spatial concentration indicates systematic targeting of border-adjacent towns and cities, rather than sporadic or purely tactical strikes.</p>"

    {
      "question": "Atmospheric Conditions of white phosphorus deployment",
      "answer": {
        "p1": "<em>Preliminary analysis based on weather data cross-referenced per incident</em>",
        "p2": "Across all verified WP incidents, a consistent atmospheric preference in the deployment of this weapon by Israel emerges. <b>Archival meteorological data were extracted from Visual Crossing Corporation for the exact date, time, and geographic coordinates of each incident</b>, enabling a precise reconstruction of the atmospheric environment in which every shell was launched and dispersed.",
        "p3": "Over <b>95%</b> of strikes occurred under <b>clear or partially cloudy skies</b>, with <b>negligible precipitation</b> recorded at the time of impact. The <b>average relative humidity</b> ranged between <b>55–70%</b>, a range that enhances the visibility of white phosphorus plumes without significantly diminishing their combustibility. Rain events were statistically rare, confirming a deliberate tendency to target during <b>dry, high-visibility windows</b>.",
        "p4": "Meteorologically, the <b>prevailing winds</b> during most incidents originated from <b>the south and southwest quadrants (190–250°)</b>  —  that is, <b>from Israeli territory toward Lebanese airspace</b>. This orientation exploited wind drift to carry toxic combustion residues northward, dispersing the plume deeper into Lebanese villages and agricultural valleys. Only a small fraction (&lt;10%) of records indicate easterly or northerly winds, suggesting that Israeli artillery generally avoided conditions where the plume might drift back toward its own positions.",
        "p5": "<b>Wind speeds</b> averaged <b>10–20 km/h</b>, with <b>gusts occasionally exceeding 30–40 km/h</b>  —  sufficient to produce horizontal shearing and broad dispersal fans visible in multiple plume recordings. These conditions favor long-range propagation of phosphorus aerosols while maintaining combustion efficiency; calm air (&lt;5 km/h) or high humidity (&gt;80%) were seldom observed, both of which would otherwise reduce spread and brightness.",
        "p6": "Chronologically, strikes clustered during <b>late morning to afternoon hours (10 AM – 5 PM)</b>  —  the period of greatest sunlight and lowest atmospheric moisture  —  reinforcing a pattern of <b>daylight signaling and spectacle</b> rather than nocturnal concealment.",
        "p7": "Thereby, the meteorological evidence reveals a clear operational logic: <b>white phosphorus was repeatedly deployed in dry, wind-stable, high-visibility atmospheres</b>, with winds blowing predominantly northward from Israeli positions  —  ensuring both <b>maximum spatial diffusion of the toxic plume and minimal risk of self-contamination</b>."

      "question": "How does the toxicity counter work?",
      "answer": {
        "brief": "The Toxicity Counter is a tracking tool that quantifies the environmental impact of white phosphorus incidents. It updates continuously as new incidents are logged on the map.",
        "incidents": "<b>Strikes: </b>Represents the total number of verified white phosphorus attacks (n = 248). Each incident is geolocated and chronolocated based on verified photo and video evidence.",
        "land-p1": "<b>Land Area:</b> <p>Estimated total contaminated surface area: 372 hectares. This is calculated using the average dispersion area per M825/M825A1 shell, based on the Forensic Architecture (2018) study “The Use of White Phosphorus Munitions in Urban Environments.”</p>",
        "land-formula": "<p>Each shell disperses phosphorus over 5,000 – 30,000 m² (≈ 0.5 – 3 ha)</p><p>We apply an average of 1.5 ha per shell as a conservative mid-range value.</p>",
        "land-p2": "Formula: Total Land Area (ha) = Total Shells × 1.5 ha",
        "air-p1": "<b>Felt Wedges:</b> <p>Each M825/M825A1 shell contains 116 white phosphorus–soaked felt wedges. Using the total number of estimated shells deployed across 248 incidents, we derive:</p> <p>Total Felt Wedges = Total Shells × 116 = 28,768 </p>",

        "notes": "<b>Limitations: </b> Dispersion varies with burst height (150–300 m), wind, and terrain. Actual ground impact may range from 0.5 – 3 ha per shell. Underreporting is likely in remote or unpopulated areas, especially during nighttime hours."
      }
    },
    {
      "question": "How does it look like on the ground?",
      "answer": "<p>When deployed, a white phosphorus shell releases 116 felt wedges impregnated with the substance. Each wedge burns at temperatures exceeding 800 °C for approximately 5 to 15 minutes, depending on wind, humidity, and impact surface (U.S. Army Technical Manual TM 3-215, 1984; Forensic Architecture, 2018). What makes white phosphorus exceptionally dangerous is its persistent reactivity — residues can reignite weeks or even months later when re-exposed to oxygen.</p><p>This persistence was confirmed in Meiss el Jabal, where a first video filmed by Green Southerners on November 26, 2023, documented active burning wedges. A second video, recorded on March 16, 2025, shows the same site nearly a year later, where a residual felt wedge reignited upon being gently disturbed. The two videos, filmed more than one year apart, demonstrate the long-term volatility and environmental danger of white phosphorus residues.</p><p>The toxic white smoke produced during combustion poses severe and ongoing risks to anyone encountering contaminated soil, vegetation, or debris.</p><br/><div class='about-video'><video height='200' width='auto' controls> <source src='/about/ground.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video></div>"
