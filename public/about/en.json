  "abstract": "<p>Over the course of one year, from Oct. 8th, 2023, to Oct. 7th, 2024, we have verified and geolocated 191 incidents of white phosphorus deployment by Israel in South Lebanon. Our website now features an interactive cartographic display that organizes this data chronologically and spatially, offering detailed insights into deployment patterns. This project serves as a continuously updated database for tracking white phosphorus munitions in South Lebanon.</p><p>Our mission is to expose the systematic use of white phosphorus, which is an incendiary weapon whose deployment in populated areas is restricted under international law due to its severe and often fatal consequences. By geolocating, verifying, and mapping instances of white phosphorus use, we aim to increase transparency and accountability in warfare. We also seek to inform residents whose lands have been contaminated by white phosphorus, preparing for post-war recovery by collaborating with local municipalities to mark affected territories and working with specialized teams to detoxify these areas. Our efforts are dedicated to ensuring that communities can safely rehabilitate and reclaim their environments once hostilities have ceased.</p>",

      "question": "What is white phosphorus?",
      "answer": "White phosphorus is a highly reactive chemical used in military operations, primarily for creating smoke screens and as an incendiary weapon. It ignites easily upon contact with air, producing a thick white smoke that effectively conceals troop movements. The immediate consequences of exposure to white phosphorus are severe; it can cause deep, painful burns upon contact with skin. Inhalation of white phosphorus smoke can damage the respiratory tract and cause breathing difficulties. Long-term exposure is linked to more serious health issues, including chronic respiratory problems and organ damage. The effects are often severe and can be fatal."
    }, {
      "question": "Is it legal to use White Phosphorus?",
      "answer": "<p>White phosphorus is regulated under international law primarily through Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which restricts its use as an incendiary weapon, particularly against civilian populations or in civilian areas. Although not an outright ban, the protocol aims to minimize harm to civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks.</p><p>While Israel has not ratified Protocol III and is not bound by its specific stipulations, it, like all nations, is still subject to International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and customary international law. These broader legal frameworks require all combatants to distinguish between military targets and civilians, prohibit indiscriminate attacks, and avoid causing unnecessary suffering. </p><p>Legally, white phosphorus can be used in military operations for creating smoke screens or signaling. Its use as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants is permissible only in scenarios that ensure compliance with IHL, particularly the principles of distinction, proportionality, and necessity. Use in civilian areas, where it can cause indiscriminate injury, is highly contentious and could potentially constitute a violation of international law.</p><p>The legality of using white phosphorus centers on the context of its use, adherence to IHL principles, and the potential for civilian harm. Misuse, especially in civilian contexts, could result in legal repercussions under international law.</p>"

        "brief": "The Toxicity Counter is a tracking tool that quantifies the environmental impact of white phosphorus incidents. It updates continuously as new incidents are logged on the map.",
        "incidents": "Incidents: Total of 191 verified incidents of white phosphorus use.",
        "land-p1": "Land Area: <p>White phosphorus can spread over a large area when deployed, determined by the height of the burst above the ground. Given a dispersal radius range of 55 meters to 190 meters, we calculate the midpoint to determine an average radius. This midpoint, 122.5 meters, represents a typical spread radius, providing a reliable estimate for most scenarios.<p/><p>To estimate the area affected by one deployment, we use the formula for the area of a circle, which is: </p>",
        "land-formula": "<ul><li>A = π x r<sup>2</sup></li><li>A = 3.14159 x (122.5 m)<sup>2</sup></li><li>A= 47123 m<sup>2</sup></li></ul>",
        "land-p2": "By multiplying the area affected by a single deployment of white phosphorus, approximately 47,123 m², by the total number of incidents (191), we find that the cumulative area impacted is about 9,000,493 m², which equals 900 hectares.",
        "air-p1": "Air Volume: <p>The volume of smoke generated by white phosphorus is primarily determined by the height at which the smoke disperses. Additionally, the volume released and its dispersal efficiency are significantly influenced by weather conditions such as wind, temperature, and particularly humidity. For our calculations, we use a standard smoke column height of 10 meters.</p><p>To estimate the volume of smoke generated from one deployment, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: </p>",
        "air-formula": "<ul><li>V = A x h</li><li>V = 47,123 m<sup>2</sup> x 10 m</li><li>V = 471,230 m<sup>3</sup></li></ul>",
        "air-p2": "<p>Each white phosphorus shell releases approximately 471,230 cubic meters of smoke, though the actual amount can vary due to factors like humidity and other atmospheric conditions, which can impact combustion efficiency and reduce smoke coverage.</p><p>By multiplying the volume of smoke generated by a single deployment, approximately 471,230 m<sup>3</sup>, by the total number of incidents (191), we find that the cumulative volume impacted is about 89,984,930 m<sup>3</sup>.</p>",
        "notes": "<i>Note: Our air volume calculations, based on the average height reached by white phosphorus smoke, provide an immediate estimate of impact. However, they do not account for the prolonged dispersion of smoke, which can significantly increase the affected area over time due to atmospheric conditions. White phosphorus can burn for a duration ranging from 5 to 15 minutes, influencing how far and wide the smoke disperses over time.</i>"

      "question": "Findings on the Use of White Phosphorus",
      "answer": "Our research has revealed an alarming pattern in the deployment of white phosphorus, suggesting it is part of a systematic strategy that extends beyond its conventional uses for incendiary purposes and creating smoke screens. It appears to be used indiscriminately over civilian areas, including homes and agricultural fields. Geolocated and verified incidents indicate a geographic strategy where white phosphorus is utilized to create an intended buffer zone along the Lebanese border. This use leads to long-term environmental contamination. Environmentally degraded areas left in the wake of such deployments will prevent residents from returning to their homes and resuming agricultural activities, which are a major part of the economy in these regions. These findings highlight the role of white phosphorus in a broader strategy that significantly impacts the demographic and economic landscape."
    }, {
      "question": "How does it look like on the ground?",
      "answer": "When deployed, a white phosphorus shell releases 161 felt wedges impregnated with the substance. These wedges can burn for 5 to 15 minutes, and they can reignite even weeks after deployment if they are exposed to oxygen, depending on environmental conditions. This persistent reactivity makes white phosphorus particularly hazardous. The intense white smoke produced by these burning wedges is a distinct hallmark of white phosphorus use, visibly marking the impact area and presenting ongoing risks to anyone encountering remnants of these munitions. <br/><br/> <video width='678' height='384' controls> <source src='/about/ground.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video>"
